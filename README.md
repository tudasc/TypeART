TypeART \[[TA18](#ref-typeart-2018); [TA20](#ref-typeart-2020)\] is a type and memory allocation tracking sanitizer. It
consists of an LLVM compiler pass and a corresponding runtime to track relevant memory allocation information during the
execution of a target program. It instruments heap, stack and global variable allocations with a callback to our
runtime. The callback consists of the runtime memory pointer value, what type (built-ins, user-defined structs etc.) and
extent of the value. This allows users of our runtime to query detailed type information behind arbitrary memory
locations, as long as they are mapped.

### Use Case: MUST - A dynamic MPI correctness checker

TypeART is used in conjunction with MUST \[[MU13](#ref-must-2013)\] to track memory (de-)allocation relevant to MPI
communication. Thus, MUST can check for type compatibility between the type-less communication buffer and the declared
MPI datatype at all phases of the MPI communication, namely message assembly, message transfer and message disassembly
into the receiving buffer. A brief summary is given in a subsequent section and more information can be found in our
publication:

## Software dependencies

TypeART requires [LLVM](https://llvm.org) version 10 and CMake version >= 3.14.

#### Building TypeART

TypeART uses CMake to build, cf. [GitHub CI build file](.github/workflows/basic-ci.yml) for a complete recipe to build.
Example build recipe (debug build, installs to default prefix
`${typeart_SOURCE_DIR}/install/typeart`)

```{.sh}
$> git clone https://github.com/tudasc/TypeART
$> cd TypeART
$> cmake -B build
$> cmake --build build --target install --parallel
```

#### CMake Configuration: Options for users

##### Runtime

- `SOFTCOUNTERS` (default: **off**) : Enable runtime tracking of #tracked addrs. / #distinct checks / etc.
- `USE_ABSL` (default: **on**) : Enable usage of btree-backed map of the abseil project instead of std::map for the
  runtime.
- `USE_BTREE` (default: **off**) : Enable usage of a btree-backed map (alternative to abseil) instead of std::map for
  the runtime.

##### Logging and Passes

- `SHOW_STATS` (default: **on**) : Passes show the statistics w.r.t. allocations etc.
- `MPI_LOGGER` (default: **on**) : Enable better logging support in MPI execution context
- `MPI_INTERCEPT_LIB` (default: **on**) : Library can be used by preloading to intercept MPI calls and check whether
  TypeART tracks the buffer pointer
- `LOG_LEVEL_` and `LOG_LEVEL_RT` (default **0**) :  Granularity of logger. 3 ist most verbose, 0 is least.

##### Testing

- `TEST_CONFIG` (default: **off**) : Set (force) logging levels to appropriate levels for test runner to succeed
- `ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE` (default: **off**) : Enable code coverage statistics using LCOV 1.14 and genhtml (gcovr
  optional)
- `ENABLE_LLVM_CODE_COVERAGE` (default: **off**) : Enable llvm-cov code coverage statistics (llvm-cov and llvm-profdata
  required)

## Using TypeART

Making use of TypeART consists of two phases:

1. Compile and instrument the target code with our LLVM passes, and,
2. execute the target program with a runtime library (based on the TypeART runtime) to accept the callbacks from the
   instrumented code and actually do some useful analysis.

To that end, the interface [RuntimeInterface.h](runtime/RuntimeInterface.h) can be used to query type information during
the target code execution.

#### Example: MPI Demo

The folder [demo](demo) contains an example of MPI related type errors that can be detected using TypeART. The code is
compiled with our instrumentation, and executed by preloading the MPI related check library implemented
in [tool.c](demo/tool.c), which is linked against the TypeART runtime and uses the aforementioned query interface. It
overloads the required MPI calls and checks that the passed `void* buffer` is correct.

## LLVM pass

The necessary allocation sites and type information are extracted in LLVM passes. TypeART analyzes:

- Calls to ```malloc``` and ```free``` to keep track of active pointers referring to objects allocated on the heap,
- relevant stack space allocations, i.e., allocations that cannot be proven to never lead to ```MPI``` functions,
- built-in as well as user-defined types to retrieve type size and the size of the allocation, e.g., for arrays.

The type information is necessary to correlate the type of the buffer passed to an MPI call with the MPI datatype the
user declared. In this prototype we restrict ourselves to:

+ primitive types (int, float, long, double, char, unsigned int, unsigned long)
+ arrays of primitive types
+ structs which contain only primitive types

### Example of Instrumentation: Handling malloc

To instrument relevant allocations and extract the necessary type information, the LLVM pass searches for specific
patterns, e.g., how calls to ```malloc``` look like in LLVM IR. Calls to the ```malloc``` function are typically call
instructions followed by a ```bitcast``` instruction to cast the returned pointer to the desired type.

~~~{.ll}
; %0 == n * sizeof(float)
%1 = tail call i8* @malloc(i64 %0)
%2 = bitcast i8* %1 to float *
~~~

The patterns has all the information we require for our instrumentation. Our transformation first detects the type that
the returned pointer is casted to, then it computes the extent of the allocation. The information is passed to our
instrumentation function.

~~~{.ll}
; %0 == n * sizeof(float)
; %1 holds the returned pointer value
%1 = tail call i8* @malloc(i64 %0)
; compute the number of elements
%2 = udiv i64 %0, 4
; call TypeART runtime (5 is the type-id for float)
call void @__typeart_alloc(i8 *%1, i32 5, i64 %2)
; original bitcast
%3 = bitcast i8* %1 to float *
~~~
